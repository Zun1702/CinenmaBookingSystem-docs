Project name: Movie88

Description:
Movie88 is a modern online cinema ticket booking system designed to deliver a fast, intuitive, and seamless experience for moviegoers. The application allows users to easily browse movies, select showtimes, choose seats via an interactive seat map, and complete secure payments through multiple gateways (VNPay, MoMo, ZaloPay).

The platform also provides an admin and staff backend interface for managing cinemas, auditoriums, seats, movies, showtimes, promotions, vouchers, and combo deals (popcorn & drinks). The system ensures data integrity, prevents duplicate seat bookings, and supports flexible discount mechanisms for marketing campaigns.
